bohverkill
==============

A fork of [mg](https://github.com/lucachr/pelican-mg).

A minimal theme for [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) that uses uikit.
The theme is suited for a single author blog without tag pages nor
blogroll. Feeds are provided via ATOM and RSS.

Everything self hosted.

Maybe buggy.
